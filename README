Outlook Birthdays done right
============================
Quick and dirty Outlook 2003 VBA macro to extend the birthday capabilities:
- More than one birthday entry per contact
- Control over the Outlook reminders for those birthdays
- Remove of all birthday entries (from this macro and the messed-up Outlook ones)
 
Note
----
These macros are developed against a german version of Outlook. They will most likely fail for other languages. Just drop my a note if you need a port to another language. Shouldn't be too difficult.
